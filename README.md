iSpindle Dashboard is a Bootstrap tool to manage and visualize data about your iSpindle.
You can display Density, Temperature, Battery life, Wifi and many other things and export your database data to a csv file.
It's intended to work with a database, but you can tweak it to read data from a csv file instead.
Enjoy. -Nikko-

V 1.0.4

For now it displays data from only 1 device, could change that in the future.

ps : i'm not a dev, so the code is not clean and there's still unnecessary stuff inside.
Might clean that in the future, or might not ^^
